// a game with four crystals and random results
// every crystal needs to have a random number between 1-12
// a new random number between 19-120 should be generated after every win or loss
// when clicking any crystal, it should add to the previous value
// until it either matches the target number or busts
// wins and losses should be tracked
// total crystal counts should be logged
